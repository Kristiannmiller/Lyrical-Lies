## About The Project

Lyrical lies is made for the lyrically challenged people of the world. The people who belt out songs with confidence, but never actually know the lyrics finally have a place to confess their lyrical transgressions. A user can visit the site, search for the song they want to view the lyrics of. A user can then anonymously post their misheard lyric for the world to see and laugh at mercilessly.

This is a Mod 3 final project for the Turing School of Software and Design's front-end program. The project focuses on key concepts learned throughout Module 3 of the front-end program. These key concepts include React, Router, and Asyncronous JavaScript. The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/binary-challenge.html).


The overall goals of this project include demonstrating mastery of React, Router, and Asyncronous JavaScript. Robust unit and integration testing are also implemented for each component utilizing the Jest testing suite.

## Usage
#### LANDING PAGE

The first page the user sees is a landing page that welcomes them to the site and brings attention to the navigation buttons

#### HOMEPAGE VIEW

The home page consists of a search bar that auto-populates using the lyrics api as the user types in a song (song title first works best)

#### LYRICS VIEW

Once a song has been chosen, the user is brought to the lyrics view to see the lyrics and any lyrical lies associated with that song. The user can also play a 30 second clip of the song.

#### COMMENTING

The user can then comment with their own Lyrical Lie (completely anonymously). That comment can also be favorited right on the lyrics view page to later be displayed with additional information on the Faves Page.

## Roadmap
The total time allotted for this project was approximately 5 days. Future features contemplated by the developer include the following:

* Add an animation to the loading page of a spinning record
* Find a more reliable api (or pay for this one to be more reliable)
* Change active/inactive state of home and faves buttons in navigation
* Responsive design

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Kristiannmiller/lyrical-lies/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
