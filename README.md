## About The Project

Lyrical lies is made for the lyrically challenged people of the world. The people who belt out songs with confidence, but never actually know the lyrics finally have a place to confess their lyrical transgressions. A user can visit the site, search for the song they want to view the lyrics of. A user can then anonymously post their misheard lyric for the world to see and laugh at mercilessly.

This is a Mod 3 final project for the Turing School of Software and Design's front-end program. The project focuses on key concepts learned throughout Module 3 of the front-end program. These key concepts include React, Router, and Asyncronous JavaScript. The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/binary-challenge.html).


The overall goals of this project include demonstrating mastery of React, Router, and Asyncronous JavaScript. Robust unit and integration testing are also implemented for each component utilizing the Jest testing suite.
